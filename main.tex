\begin{abstract}
  We present a full analysis of an efficient algorithm for the
  computation of at least one point in each connected component of a
  smooth real hypersurface, taking into account bit complexity and
  all coefficient growth.  This problem is a basic and important
  subroutine used in semi-algebraic geometry. For instance, it is used
  in determining an upper bound on the number of connected components
  of a real hypersurface. The algorithm requires some genericity
  properties, which we ensure through random changes of variables that
  produce generic coordinate systems. In order to ensure these
  properties with arbitrarily high probability, we developed a new
  quantitative extension of Thom's weak transversality theorem, and a
  new quantitative Noether normalization statement for polar
  varieties. These statements enable us to give a precise probability
  analysis of a monte carlo algorithm, where we can guarantee
  correctness with arbitrarily high probability.

  Algorithms for deciding connectivity queries in real algebraic
  geometry have been developed in a series of papers
  \cite{EMP,SchostMohabBabySteps2011,SchostMohabBabySteps2014,TWT}. However, these algorithms are based in the
  arithmetic complexity model, and analyses of the bit complexity
  questions were left for future work.  Our results are an important
  first step in this analysis.

\section{Introduction}
%
\subsection{Problem statement}
%
Let $f \in \mathbb{Q}[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$ be squarefree with total degree $D$ and $V(f)$ smooth. We provide bit-complexity estimates for computing one point in each connected component of $V(f)\cap \R^n.$ Its bit complexity is $\hdots$.
%
\subsection{Motivation}
%
\subsubsection{Applications}
%
Computing one point in each connected component of the real part of a hypersurface is a basic and important subroutine used in semi-algebraic geometry. For instance, it is used in determining an upper bound on the number of connected components of a real hypersurface, and it is used in determining whether or not a complex hypersurface has real solutions. 

\subsubsection{Bit-complexity}
Algorithms for deciding connectivity queries in real algebraic geometry
have been developed in a series of papers
\cite{EMP,SchostMohabBabySteps2011,SchostMohabBabySteps2014,TWT}. However,
these algorithms are based in the arithmetic complexity model, and bit
complexity questions have been left for future work. As bit complexity
provides a far more realistic model of computation compared to arithmetic
complexity,  which only counts each operation at unit cost and does not
account for coefficient size, our results therefore address an important
missing aspect of previous research.

Note that by the bit complexity we mean to count the number of all machine
operations require on a standard computer in terms of the length of a
standard representation (accounting for coefficient size, etc.). See below
for formal definitions.

\subsubsection{Quantitative genericity statements}
%
\subsection{Main result}
%
\begin{theorem}
Suppose that $f\in\Q[X_1\hdots,X_n]$ is squarefree and satisfies $\deg f \leq D, \htt(f) \leq s,$ and assume that $f$ is given by a straight-line program $\Gamma$ of size $L$ with integer constants of height at most $b.$ There exists a randomized algorithm that takes $\Gamma, d,$ and $s$ as input and produces a zero-dimensional parameterization of a set that contains at least one point in each connected component of $V(f) \cap \R^n$ with probability at least $1/2$. Otherwise the algorithm either produces a subset of the points or FAIL. In any case, the algorithm uses 
\[
O^{\sim}(kn(Lb+D^{2n}(s+D)(L+n^3D+n^4)))
\]
bit operations, with $k \geq -\lg(1-2^{(-1/n)})$. The polynomials in the output have degree at most $D^n,$ and height at most
\[
O^{\sim}((s+D)D^n + nD^n).
\]
\end{theorem}
%
The algorithm can error on one side by producing a proper subset of the points. Running the algorithm $\kt$ times gives a list of $n$ zero-dimensional parameterizations, among which the highest cardinality output includes at least one point in each connected component with probability at least $1-(1/2)^{\kt}.$

\section{Notation and preliminaries}
%
\subsection{Algebraic sets}
%
An \textit{algebraic set} $V \subset \C^n$ is the set of common zeros of a set of polynomials $\textit{\textbf{f}}=(f_1,\hdots,f_s)$ in $\C[X_1,\hdots,X_n].$
\subsubsection{Dimension and degree}
The \textit{dimension} of an algebraic set $V \subset \C^n$, denoted $\dim V,$ can be defined in the following ways:
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The number of generic hyperplanes needed to intersect with $V$ to obtain a finite set. 
    \item The Krull Dimension of $\C[X_1,\hdots,X_n]/I(V)$.
\end{enumerate}
%
The \textit{codimension} of $V$ is $n - \dim V$. An algebraic set is \textit{equidimensional} if each irreducible component has the same dimension.  If each component has dimension $d$ then we say it is $d-$equidimensional. 
The \textit{degree} of an algebraic set is the number of intersection points between itself and $\dim V$ generic hyperplanes.
%
\begin{example} 
An algebraic set of dimension zero is a finite set, with degree equal to its cardinality.
\end{example}
%
\begin{example}
An algebraic set of dimension 1 is a curve, with degree equal to the number of intersection points with a generic hyperplane.
\end{example}
%
\subsection{Bit-size, height and degree}
%
For $r \leq n,$ $\textit{\textbf{X}}_{\leq r}$ denotes $[X_1,\hdots,X_r]$ and $\textit{\textbf{X}}$ denotes $[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$. 
\par 
For $a=\frac{u}{v}$ in $\mathbb{Q}-\{0\},$ the  \textit{height} of $a,$ $\htt(a),$ is the maximum of $\log(|u|)$ and $\log(|v|),$ where $u \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $v \in \mathbb{N}$ are coprime. If $v$ is the minimal common denominator of all non zero coefficients of $f$, then the \textit{height} of $f, \htt(f),$ is defined as the maximum of the logarithms of $v$ and of the absolute values of the coefficients of $vf$. 
%
\par
We write $\htt(\textit{\textbf{f}})=(\htt(f_1),\hdots,\htt(f_N))$ and assume that $\htt(\textit{\textbf{f}}) \leq \textit{\textbf{s}} = (S_1,\hdots,s_N),$  with $\htt(f_i) \leq s_i$ for all $i \in \{ 1,\hdots,N\}.$
%
\subsection{Data structures}
%
\subsubsection{Strait-line programs}
%
\subsubsection{Zero-dimensional parameterizations}
%
\subsection{Critical / singular points}
%
\subsubsection{Regular and singular points of varieties}
%
Let $V \subset \C^n$ be a $d$-equidimensional algebraic set. 
The point $x \in V$ is a \textit{regular point} if $\dim (T_xV) = d.$ Otherwise $x$ is a \textit{singular point}. We let $\reg(V)$ and $\sing(V)$ respectively denote the regular and singular points of $V$. 
\par 
We assume that $V$ is smooth so that $V=\reg(V).$
%
\subsubsection{Critical points of polynomial mappings}
%
Let $\phi : V \rightarrow \C^m$ be a polynomial mapping. A \textit{critical point} of $\phi$ is a regular point of $V$ with $d_x \phi(T_xV) \not = \C^m,$ where $d_x \phi$ is the differential of $\phi$ at $x.$ A \textit{critical} value of $\phi$ is the image of a critical point by $\phi$.
%
\subsection{The zariski-tangent space}
%
Denote by $\grad_{\xb}(f)$ the evaluation of the gradient vector of $f$ in $\C[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$ at $\textit{\textbf{x}}$ in $\C$.
The \textit{Zariski-tangent space} to $V$ at $\textit{\textbf{x}} \in V$ is the vector space $T_{\xb}V$ defined by the equations $\grad_{\xb}(f) \cdot \textit{\textbf{v}}=0$ for all polynomials $f$ that vanish on $V$. For a polynomial system $\textit{\textbf{f}}=(f_1,\hdots,f_N)$ in $\C[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$, denote by $\jac(\textit{\textbf{f}})$ the Jacobian matrix.
The following is a direct consequence of \cite[Corollary 16.20]{ECA}.
%
\begin{proposition}
If $V \subset \C^n$ is a $d$-equidimensional algebraic set with ideal $I(V)=\langle f_1,\hdots,f_N \rangle$, then at any point $\textbf{x}$ of $\reg(V),$ $\jac_\textbf{x}(\textbf{f})$ has full rank $n - \dim(V)$ and the kernel of $\jac_\textbf{x}(\textbf{f})$ is equal to $T_\textbf{x}V.$ 
\end{proposition}
%
\subsection{Polar varieties}
%
Let $V\subset \C^n$ be a smooth $d$-equidimensional variety. For $i \in \{1,\hdots,d\},$ denote by $\pi_i:\C^n \rightarrow \C^i$ the projection
$(x_1,\hdots,x_n) \mapsto  (x_1,\hdots,x_i)$. A \textit{critical point} $\textit{\textbf{x}}$ in $V$ is a singular point on $\pi_i.$ In other words, the point $\textit{\textbf{x}} \in V$ is a critical point if $\dim \pi_i( T_\textit{\textbf{x}}V) < i$. The $i$-th  \textit{polar variety} \[W(\pi_i,V) := \{\textit{\textbf{x}} \in V~|~\dim \pi_i(T_xV) < i\}\] is the set of critical points of $\pi_i$ on $V$. Denote by $\I$ the ideal \[\frak{I}(\pi_i,V) := I(W(\pi_i,V)).\] 
%
\begin{proposition} 
Consider $f \in \mathbb{Q}[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$ squarefree with $V(f)$ smooth. Then, for $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}$, the polar variety $W(\pi_i,V)$ is defined by the vanishing of \[f,\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n}.\]
\end{proposition}
%
\begin{proof}
We have a proof but maybe we should reference it?
\end{proof}
%
\subsection{Changes of variables}
%
Consider $A \in \C^{n^2}, f \in \C[X_1,\hdots,X_n], \textit{\textbf{x}} \in \mathbb{C}^n,$ and $V \subset \C^n$. We denote by 
$V^A$ the set $\{x^A~|~\xb \in V\}, f^A$ the polynomial $f(A \xb)$ and $\xb^A$ denotes $A^{-1}\xb$. Notice $f^A(\xb^A) = f(A A^{-1}\xb)=f(\xb).$
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
\section{Genericity properties}
%
Consider $f \in \mathbb{Q}[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$ with total degree $D$.  
We say that $f$ satisfies $\textbf{H}$ if 
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f$ is squarefree;
    \item $V(f)$ is smooth.
\end{enumerate}
%
An equidimensional algebraic set $X$ of dimension $d$ is in \textit{Noether position} for $\pi_d$ when the extension 
\[
\C[X_1,\hdots,X_d] \rightarrow \C[X_1,\hdots,X_n]/I(V)
\] 
is injective and integral.  Then, for any $\xb \in \C^d,$ the fiber 
$V \cap \pi_d^{-1}(\xb)$ has dimension zero. For $i\in\{1,\hdots,n\}$, and for a randomly chosen point $p_{i-1} = (x_1,\hdots,x_{i-1}) \in \Q^{i-1}$, we say that $f$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}$ if 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\I(\pi_i,V)$ is radical;
\item either $W(\pi_i,V)$ is empty or $(i-1)$-equidimensional;
\item $W(\pi_i,V)$ is smooth;
\item $\langle X_1-x_1,\hdots,X_{i-1}-x_{i-1}, f,  \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n}\rangle $ is radical; 
\item $V(X_1-x_1,\hdots,X_{i-1}-x_{i-1}, f,  \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n})$ is finite;
\item $V(X_1-x_1,\hdots,X_{i-1}-x_{i-1}, f,  \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n})$ is smooth;
\item either $W(\pi_i,V)$ is empty or in Noether position for $\pi_{i-1}$.
\end{enumerate}
%
\begin{theorem}
Suppose that $f \in \Q[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$ satisfies \textbf{H}. Then there exists a Zariski closed set $\D \subset \mathbb{C}^{n^2}$ of degree at most $D^{\textrm{\td}}$ such that, if $\textbf{A}$ is chosen from  $\C^{n^2}-\Delta$ ( $\Q^{n^2}-\Delta$?) then $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}$ for all $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}.$
\end{theorem}
%
\begin{corollary} 
Fix $S \subset \mathbb{Q}$ with $|S| \geq \epsilon^{-1} D^{\textrm{\td}}$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Then for $A\in S^{n^2}$ chosen randomly, the probability that $f^A$ satisfies $H_i^{'}$ for all $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}$ is at least $1-\epsilon.$
\end{corollary}

\section{Weak Transversality}

Sard's lemma states that the set of critical values of a smooth
function $\R^n \to \R^m$ has measure zero. One can give ``algebraic''
versions of it, for semi-algebraic mappings $\R^n \to \R^m$ as
in~\cite[Chapter~9]{bochnak1998real} or polynomial mappings $\C^n \to
\C^m$ as in~\cite[Chapter~3]{Mumford76}, for which the sets of critical
values are contained in strict semi-algebraic, resp.\ algebraic sets
in the codomain. Thom's weak transversality lemma, as given for
instance in~\cite{demazure2000bifurcations}, generalizes Sard's
lemma. In this section, we consider a particular case of this result
(transversality to a point), and establish a quantitative version of
it. Our presentation is inspired by that in~\cite{TWT}.

%% ; it states that if a smooth function
%% $F(\Xb,\Lambda)$, depending on parameters $\Lamdba$ in $\C^s$ is
%% ``transverse'' to a certain submanifold in its domain space, then for
%% most values $\lambda \in \C^s$, $F(\Xb,\lambda)$ remains

Transversality to a point can be rephrased entirely in terms of
critical and regular values. Recall that if $\bm \Psi$ is a mapping
from a smooth algebraic set $Y$ to $\C^t$, with $t\le \dim(Y)$, a {\em
  critical point} of $\bm \Psi$ is a point $\bm y \in Y$ such that the
image of the tangent space $T_{\bm y} Y$ by the differential $d_{\bm
  Y} \bm \Psi$ has dimension less than $t$. When for instance
$Y=\C^v$, we have $T_{\bm y} Y=\C^v$ and this condition is equivalent
to the Jacobian of $\bm \Psi$ having rank less than $t$ at $\bm y$.  A
{\em regular point} of $\bm \Psi$ is a point on $Y$ that is not
critical. {\em Critical values} are the images of critical points; the
complement of this set are the {\em regular values} (so a regular
value is not necessarily in the image of $\bm\Psi$).

Let $n,\dt,$ and $m$ be positive integers, with $m \le n$, and denote
by $\bm\Phi :\C^n \times \C^{\dt} ~ \rightarrow \C^{m}$ a mapping
defined by polynomials in $\C[\Xb,\Thetab]$, where $\Xb$,
resp.\ $\Thetab$, is a set of $n$, resp.\ $\dt$, indeterminates.  For
$\thetab$ in $\C^{\dt}$, let $\bm\Phi_{\thetab} : \C^n \rightarrow
\C^{m}$ be the induced mapping $\xb\mapsto \bm\Phi(\xb,\thetab)$.  The
transversality result we will need is the following.

\begin{proposition} [Weak transversality]\label{prop:weak_t}
  Suppose that $\bm 0$ is a regular value of $\bm\Phi$. Then there
  exists a hypersurface $\Delta \subset \C^{\dt}$ of degree at most
  \td for which, if $\thetab \in \C^{\dt}-\Delta$, then $\bm 0$ is a
  regular value of~$\bm\Phi_{\thetab}$.
\end{proposition}

Here is a simple example that shows this result at work. Consider a
squarefree $f$ in $\C[X_1,X_2]$, such that $V(f)$ is a smooth curve in
$\C^2$, and let the mapping $\bm\Phi:\C^2\times \C \to \C^2$ be defined
by $\bm\Phi(X_1,X_2,\Lambda) = (f(X_1,X_2), X_1-\Lambda)$. One checks
that the Jacobian of $\bm\Phi$ with respect to $(X_1,X_2,\Lambda)$ has
rank two at any point in $\bm\Phi^{-1}(\bm 0)$, so the assumptions of the
proposition apply. We deduce that for a generic $\lambda$ in $\C$,
that is, for all $\lambda$ in $\C$ except a finite number, the ideal
$(f(X_1,X_2), X_1-\lambda)$ is radical in $\C[X_1,X_2]$; equivalently,
$f(\lambda, X_2)$ is squarefree. We will revisit this example in
Section~\td.

The rest of the section is devoted to the proof of the proposition.
The proof of \cite[Theorem B.3]{TWT} already shows the existence of
$\Delta$; it is essentially the classical proof for smooth
mappings~\cite[Section~3.7]{demazure2000bifurcations}, written in an
algebraic context. In what follows, we revisit this proof,
establishing a bound on the degree of $\Delta$.

We will reuse the following fact proved in~\cite{TWT}.  Put $V =
\bm\Phi^{-1}(0)$ and consider the projection $\pi:(\xb, \thetab) \in
\C^n \times \C^{\dt} \mapsto \thetab \in\C^{\dt}$.  If $V$ is empty,
there is nothing to do, since all values $\thetab$ in $\C^\dt$ satisfy
the conclusion of the theorem. Thus, we assume that $V$ is not
empty. Then, the Jacobian criterion shows that $V$ is
smooth and $(n+ \dt -m)$-equidimensional.

Let $Z$ be the set of critical points of $\pi_{|V}$, and consider its
projection $\pi(Z)$ in $\C^s$. This is the set of critical values of
$\pi_{|V}$; hence, by the algebraic form of Sard's lemma (see
\cite[Theorem~3.7]{Mumford76} for irreducible $V$
and~\cite[Proposition~B.2]{TWT} for general $V$), its Zariski closure
$\overline{\pi(Z)}$ is a strict closed subset of $\C^s$. Now, the
proof of \cite[Theorem B.3]{TWT} shows that if $\thetab \in \C^{\dt}$
is not in $\overline{\pi(Z)}$, then $\bm 0$ is a critical value of
$\bm\Phi_{\thetab}$. Hence, it suffices to prove that $Z$ has degree
at most $d^{m+n}$; this will imply the same degree bound for
$\overline{\pi(Z)}$, and prove our propositon.


We first describe the set $Z$ of critical points of $\pi_{|V}$.  Let
$M$ denote the $(s+m) \times (s+n)$ matrix with entries in
$\C[\Xb,\Thetab]$ given by $M = \jac_{\Xb,\Thetab}(\pi,\bm\Phi)$, that
is,
\begin{align*}
M &= 
\bbm

\end{align*}

\begin{lemma} 
  For $(\xb,\thetab)$ in $V$, the matrix $M$ has full rank $\dt+m$ at
  $(\xb,\thetab)$ if and only if $(\xb,\thetab)$ is a regular point of
  $\pi_{|V}.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Take $(\xb,\thetab)$ on $V$, and let $K(\xb,\thetab)$ be the
  Jacobian matrix $\jac_{(\Xb,\Thetab)}(\bm\Phi)$ at $(\xb,\thetab)$.
  Then, the rank of $M(\xb,\thetab)$ can be written as
  $\textup{rank}(K(\xb,\thetab)) + \textup{rank}([\textbf{0}_{\dt
      \times n}~\textbf{I}_{\dt}] \mid \ker K(\xb,\thetab))$, where
  the latter is the rank of the restriction of $[\textbf{0}_{\dt
      \times n}~\textbf{I}_{\dt}]$ to the nullspace of
  $K(\xb,\thetab)$.

  Since $V$ is smooth, $K(\xb,\thetab)$ has full rank ${\rm codim} (V)
  = m$. On the other hand, the nullspace of $K(\xb,\thetab)$ is the
  tangent space $T_{\xb,\thetab} V$, and
  $\textup{rank}([\textbf{0}_{\dt \times n}~\textbf{I}_{\dt}] \mid
  \ker K(\xb,\thetab))$ is the dimension of $\pi(T_{\xb,\thetab} V)$.
  In other words, the rank of $M(\xb,\thetab)$ is equal to
  $m+\dim(\pi(T_{\xb,\thetab} V))$; this implies the claim in the lemma.
\end{proof}


Therefore, we can characterize the set $Z$ of critical points of
$\pi_{|V}$ as those points satisfying $\bm\Phi(\xb,\thetab)=\bm 0$ and
where all minors of $M$ of order $\dt+m$ vanish. We can describe this
set using fewer equations, by discarding certain minors that are
identically zero. Let indeed $J$ denote the $m \times n$ submatrix of
the Jacobian of $\bm\Phi$ consisting of the first $n$ columns.
\begin{lemma} 
  For $(\xb,\thetab)$ in $V$, $(\xb,\thetab)$ is in $Z$ if and only if
  $J(\xb,\thetab)$ has rank less than $m$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Notice 
%
\begin{align*}
M(\xb,\thetab)&= 
\bbm 
\textbf{0}_{\dt \times n} &\textbf{I}_{\dt} \\
J(\xb,\thetab)     &J'(\xb,\thetab)
\ebm,
\end{align*}
where $J'$ consists of the remaining columns of the Jacobian matrix of
$\bm\Phi$.  Then, the rank of the former matrix is equal to the rank
of
\begin{align*}
M(\xb,\thetab)&= 
\bbm 
\textbf{0}_{\dt \times n} &\textbf{I}_{\dt} \\
J(\xb,\thetab)     & \bm 0_{m \times s}
\ebm,
\end{align*}
and the conclusion follows.
\end{proof}
Therefore, the set $Z$ can be defined as the set of all
$(\xb,\thetab)$ in $\C^{n+\dt}$ satisfying $\bm\Phi(\xb,\thetab)=\bm
0$ and where all minors of $J$ of order $m$ vanish. Our next step is
to bound the degree of $Z$. For this, rather than considering minors
of $J$, we will rewrite the condition that $J(\xb,\thetab)$ has rank
less than $m$ as the existence of a non-trivial left kernel element.

For this, we let $\textit{\textbf{L}}=[L_1,\hdots,L_m]$ be new
variables, thought of as Lagrange multipliers, and consider the
``Lagrange polynomials'' $\mathscr{L}_1,\dots,\mathscr{L}_{n}$, with
\[
[\mathscr{L}_1 \cdots \mathscr{L}_{n}]=\textit{\textbf{L}}\cdot J(\xb,\thetab).
\] 
Denote by $\frak{Z} \subset \C^{n+\dt+m}$ the algebraic set defined by
the vanishing of $\mathscr{L}_1,\hdots,\mathscr{L}_{n},$ and
$\bm\Psi$, and by $\frak{Z}'$ the algebraic set
\[
\frak{Z}' := \overline{\frak{Z} - \{(\textit{\textbf{x}},\thetab,0,\hdots,0) \in \C^{n+\dt+m}~|~(\textit{\textbf{x}},\thetab,0\hdots,0) \in \frak{Z}\}},
\]
where the bar denotes Zariski closure (we have to remove such points,
since $L_1=\cdots=L_m=0$ is always a trivial solution to the Lagrange
equations). Finally, consider the projection
\begin{align*} 
\mu :~ \C^{n+\dt+m} &\rightarrow \C^{n+\dt}\\
(\textit{\textbf{x}},\thetab,\bm \ell)~ &\mapsto (\textit{\textbf{x}},\thetab).
\end{align*}

\begin{lemma}  
  The algebraic set $Z$ is equal to the projection $\mu(\frak{Z}')$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Take $(\xb,\thetab)$ in $Z$. Then, $(\xb,\thetab)$ cancels all
  polynomials $\bm \Phi$, and there exists $\bm
  \ell=(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_m)$, not identically zero, such that
  $(\xb,\thetab,\bm \ell)$ cancels the Lagrange polynomials. This
  implies that $(\xb,\thetab,\bm \ell)$ is in $\frak{Z} -
  \{(\textit{\textbf{x}}',\thetab',0,\hdots,0) \in
  \C^{n+\dt+m}~|~(\textit{\textbf{x}}',\thetab',0\hdots,0) \in
  \frak{Z}\}$, and thus in $\frak{Z}'$. This proves the inclusion
  $Z \subset \mu(\frak{Z}')$.

  Conversely, take an irreducible component $Y$ of $\frak Z'$. We prove 
  that $\mu(Y)$ is contained in $Z$.
  By construction, there exists an open dense subset $Y^o \subset Y$
  such that for any $(\xb,\thetab,\bm \ell)$ in $Y^o$, $\bm \ell$ is
  not identically zero. As a result, $(\xb,\thetab)$ is in $Z$, that
  is, $\mu(Y^o)$ is in $Z$. This implies that its Zariski closure
  $\overline{\mu(Y^o)}$ is in $Z$. Since $\mu(Y)$ is contained in
  $\overline{\mu(Y^o)}$, we have $\mu(Y) \subset Z$. Taking 
  the union over all $Y$, we get $\mu(\frak Z') \subset Z$, as claimed.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{corollary} 
  The degree of $Z$ is at most $d^{m+n}.$
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  The algebraic set $\frak Z$ is defined by $m+n$ equations, all of
  them having degree at most $d$. It follows from B\'ezout's
  Theorem~\cite{H} that $\deg(\frak{Z}) \leq d^{m+n}$, and the same
  upper bound holds for $\deg(\frak{Z}')$. Applying the projection
  $\mu$ yields the result.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Genericity and Sard's lemma}
%
It will sometimes be useful for us use in replace of the matrix $A$, a matrix representing indeterminants: let $\A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix of new indeterminates $(\A_{i,j})_{1 \leq i , j \leq n}.$ Define $f^{\A} \in \mathbb{Q}(\A_{i,j})[\textbf{X}]$ as $f(\A\textbf{X})$ and $V^\A=V(f^\A).$ It follows from Proposition 5.1, that for a generic $A \in \C^{n^2},$ $0$ is a regular value of $\Phi_{A}$.  The proof of \cite[Theorem B.3]{TWT}, which establishes the existence of $\Delta \subset \C^{n^2},$ applies \textit{Sard's lemma}, which shows that the critical values of a polynomial mapping are contained in a hypersurface. It follows from Sard's lemma that, for the matrix of indeterminants $\A,$ $0$ is a regular value of $\Phi_{\A}.$ Otherwise it could not be that $0$ is a regular value of $\Phi_A,$ for a generic $A\in \C^{n^2}.$ The proof is routine and we omit details. It then follows that 
\[
\jac_{\xb}(\Phi_{\A}) = \jac_{\xb}\left(f^{\A}(\xb),\frac{\pa f^{\A}(\xb)}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f^{\A}(\xb)}{\pa X_n}\right)
\]
has full rank for all $\xb \in V(f^{\A})$, and thus $f^{\A}$satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(1),\textbf{H}_i^{'}(2)$ and $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(3)$ by the Jacobian criterion \cite[Theorem 16.19]{ECA}. We will rely on this fact in Section 8.
%
\section{Proof of $\textbf{H}_i'(1),\textbf{H}_i'(2)$ and $\textbf{H}_i'(3)$}
%
We assume our input polynomial $f$ satisfies \textbf{H} so that $f$ is squarefree with $V(f) \cap \mathbb{R}^n$ smooth. Thus, by Proposition 2.4,  $W(\pi_i,V(f))$ is defined by the vanishing of $f,\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n}.$ If the Jacobian of this set of polynomials has full rank at all $\xb \in V(f) \cap \mathbb{R}^n,$ then it follows by the Jacobian criterion \cite[Theorem 16.19]{ECA} that $f$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(1),\textbf{H}_i^{'}(2)$ and $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(3)$. 
%
\begin{theorem}
There exists a Zariski closed set $\Delta_1 \subset \C^{n^2}$ of degree at most $D^{2n^2}$ with the property that, if $A \in \C^{n^2} - \Delta_1$ then for each $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\},$ $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(1),\textbf{H}_i^{'}(2)$ and $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(3)$.
\end{theorem}
%
\subsection{Sketch of the proof of Theorem 5.1}
%
For each $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}$, let $\Phi_i$ be the polynomial mapping 
\[
\Phi_i : (\xb,A) \mapsto \left(f^A(\xb), \frac{\partial f^A}{\partial X_{i+1}}(\xb),\hdots,\frac{\partial f^A}{\partial X_n}(\xb)\right),
\] 
so that $\Phi_{i,A}^{-1}(0)= W(\pi_i,V^A).$ We want to apply Theorem 5.1, and thus we show that $\bz$ is a regular value of $\Phi_i$, where then it follows that $\Xi_i \subset \C^{n^2}$ exists with the property that if $A \in \C^{n^2}-\Xi_i$ then  
\[
\jac_{\xb}(\Phi_{i,A}) = \jac_{\xb}\left(f^A(\xb),\frac{\pa f^A(\xb)}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f^A(\xb)}{\pa X_n}\right)
\]
has full rank at all $\xb \in V(f^A)~(\cap\R^n$?). Then, by the Jacobian criterion \cite[Theorem 16.19]{ECA}, $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(1),\textbf{H}_i^{'}(2)$ and $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(3)$. To obtain the result for all $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}$, we take 
\[
\Delta_1 = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \Xi_i 
\]
where we can bound the degree by observing that 
\[
\deg \Delta_1 \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \deg \Xi_i.
\]
%
\subsection{Proof of Theorem 5.1}
%
Fix $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}$, and let $\Phi_i$ be as stated above.
%
\begin{proposition} 
$\bz$ is a regular value of $\Phi_i$.
\end{proposition}
%
\begin{proof}
Let $A_1,\hdots,A_n$ denote the columns of $A,$ and let $(\xb,A) \in \C^n \times \C^{n^2}$ be such that 
$f^A(\xb) = \frac{\partial f^A(\xb)}{\partial X_{i+1}}=\hdots= \frac{\partial f^A(\xb)}{\partial X_n}=\bz.$
We want to show that the Jacobian of the system of polynomials 
\[
f(A\xb),(\grad(f)\cdot A_{i+1})(A\xb),\hdots, (\grad(f)\cdot A_n)(A\xb)
\]
at $(\xb,A)$ has full rank, which holds if and only if the Jacobian of the system of polynomials 
\[
f,\grad(f)\cdot A_{i+1},\hdots, \grad(f)\cdot A_n
\]
at $(\xb,A)$ has full rank. Let $\Psi_i$ be the mapping
%
\begin{align*}
    \Psi_i: \C^n \times \C^{n^2} &\rightarrow \C^{n-i+1} \\
       (\xb,A) &\mapsto 
       \left(f(\xb),\grad(f(\xb))\cdot 
A_{i+1},\hdots
\grad(f(\xb))\cdot 
A_{n}
\right).
\end{align*}
%
For all $(\xb,A) \in \Psi_i^{-1}(0),$ the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi_i$ at $(\xb,A)$ has full rank $n-i+1$. Indeed, set 
\[
F_j = \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_1} a_{i+j,1} + \hdots + \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n}a_{i+j,n}, ~1 \leq j \leq n-i,
\]
so that the Jacobian is equal to
\[
\left[ 
\begin{array}{cccccc}
\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_1} \hdots \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n}            &0\hdots 0&\hdots& 0 \hdots 0                                         & \hdots & 0\hdots 0 \\ 
\frac{\pa F_{1}}{\pa X_1}\hdots \frac{\pa F_{1}}{\pa X_n}     &0\hdots 0&\hdots& \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_1} \hdots \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n} & \hdots & 0\hdots 0 \\
\ddots                                                        &0\hdots 0&\ddots&\ddots                                              & \ddots & \ddots \\
\frac{\pa F_{n-i}}{\pa X_1}\hdots \frac{\pa F_{n-i}}{\pa X_n} &0\hdots 0&\hdots&0 \hdots 0&  \hdots & \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_1} \hdots \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n}  
\end{array}
\right]. 
\] 
Since $f$ is square-free, $I(V(f)) = \langle f \rangle.$ Therefore, for all $\xb \in V(f)$, 
\[
T_{\xb} V(f) = \textrm{Nullspace}(\grad_{\xb} f).
\]
Since $V(f)$ is smooth, $T_{\xb} V(f)$ has dimension $n-1$ and one partial vanishes. At least one partial of $f$ must be non-zero. Since  $\frac{\pa f}{\pa X_1} \hdots \frac{\pa f}{\pa X_n}$ appears in $n-i+1$ rows, the matrix has full rank $n-i+1$.
\end{proof}
%
Since $\deg \Phi_i \leq D,$ it follows by Theorem 5.1 that a hypersurface $\Xi_i \subset \C^{n^2}$ exists, of degree at most $D^{n+(n-i+1)}=D^{2n-i+1}\leq D^{2n},$ with the property that, if $A \in \C^{n^2}-\Xi_i,$ then 
%
\[
 \jac_\xb \left(f^A,\frac{\pa f^A}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f^A}{\pa X_n}\right)
\]
has full rank for all $\xb \in V(f^A)$ ($\cap \R^n$?), so that  $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(1),\textbf{H}_i^{'}(2)$ and $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(3)$ by the Jacobian criterion \cite[Theorem 16.19]{ECA}. Now, to prove the claim for all $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\},$ we take
\[
\Delta_1 := \bigcup_{i=1}^n \Xi_i,
\]
where we have the following bound on the degree which proves the claim:
\[
\deg \Delta_1 \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \deg \Xi_i  \leq D^{2n^2}.
\]

\section{Proof of $\textbf{H}_i'(4),\textbf{H}_i'(5)$ and $\textbf{H}_i'(6)$}
%
\begin{theorem}
There exists a Zariski closed set $\Delta_2 \subset \C^{n^2}$ of degree at most $D^{\textrm{?}}$ with the property that, if $A \in \C^{n^2} - \Delta_2$ then for each $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\},$ $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i'(4),\textbf{H}_i'(5)$ and $\textbf{H}_i'(6)$.
\end{theorem}
%
\subsection{Sketch of the proof of Theorem 6.1}
%
Let 
\[
Y_i = X_i^{A} = [b_i] \cdot \bbm X_1\\ \vdots \\ X_n \ebm, 
\]
where $b_i$ is the i-th row of $A^{-1}$. For $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}$, we want to show that the Jacobian of the system of polynomials
\[
Y_1(\xb),\hdots,Y_{i-1}(\xb), f(\xb),  \frac{\pa f(A\xb)}{\pa X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\pa f(A\xb)}{\pa X_n}
\]
has full rank, at all points $\xb \in \C^n$ with 
\[
X_1(\xb)=\hdots,X_{i-1}(\xb)=f(\xb)= \frac{\pa f(xb)}{\pa X_{i+1}}=\hdots = \frac{\pa f(\xb)}{\pa X_{n}}=0.
\]
Then we could use Theorem 5.1 to obtain a hypersurface with the desired properties. Let $\Phi$ be the mapping 
%
\begin{align*}
    \Phi: \C^n \times \C^{n^2} &\rightarrow \C^{n+1} \\
           (\xb,A) &\mapsto 
       (Y_1,\hdots,Y_i,f(\xb),\grad(f(\xb))\cdot A_{i+1},\hdots \\
       \hdots&~,\grad(f(\xb))\cdot A_{n})),
\end{align*}
%
We cannot directly define the appropriate polynomial mapping, as $Y_j(A\xb)$ is rational in $A^{-1}.$ To circumvent this issue, we can alternativly define a polynomial mapping $\Psi$ as  
%
\begin{align*}
    \Psi: \C^n \times \C^{n^2} \times \C &\rightarrow \C^{n+2} \\
           (\xb,A,T) &\mapsto 
       (\Yt_1,\hdots,\Yt_i,f(\xb),\grad(f(\xb))\cdot A_{i+1},\hdots \\
\hdots,\grad(f(\xb))\cdot A_{n}),&~T\cdot \det (A) - 1),
\end{align*}
%
where $\Yt_j=TY_j$ with denominators cleared. Now, look at the points in $\Psi^{-1}(0).$ Here, $\det A \not = 0$ and therefore invertible, and therefore at all points in $\Psi^{-1}(0)$ the Jacobian matrix has full rank? 
%
\begin{proposition}
For all $(\xb,A) \in \Psi^{-1}(0),$ the Jacobian matrix of $\Psi$ at $(\xb,A)$ has full rank (i.e. $\Psi$ is transverse to $\{0\}).$
\end{proposition}
%
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
%
Thus, by Theorem 5.1, there exists a hypersurface $\Delta_2 \subset \C^{n^2}$, of degree at most $D^{n+1}$ with the property that if $A \in \C^{n^2}-\Delta_2$ then $\jac_{\xb}\Psi_A$ has full rank. $\hdots$ It then follows that for all $A \in \C^{n^2}-\Delta_2, \jac_{\xb}\Phi_A$ also has full rank. Therefore, by the Jacobian criterion, $f^A$ satisfies  $\textbf{H}_i'(4),\textbf{H}_i'(5)$ and $\textbf{H}_i'(6)$.

\begin{theorem}
There exists a hypersurface $\Delta_3 \subset \C^{n^2}$ of degree at most $\td$ with the property that, if $A \in \C^{n^2} - \Delta_3$ then, for each $i \in\{1,\hdots,n\}, f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i'(7)$.
\end{theorem}
%
Section 7 is devoted to proving Theorem 7.1. It has already been shown in \cite{EMP} that $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(7)$ for a generic change of variables. The new contribution is in upper bounding the degree of $\Delta_3.$
%
\begin{proposition} 
The ring extension \[\mathbb{Q}(\frak{A})[\textbf{X}_{\leq i-1}]\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}(\frak{A})[\textbf{X}]/\I^{\A}\] is integral.
\end{proposition}
%
\begin{proof}
Let $(\frak{P}_l)_{l \leq L}$ be the prime components of the radical ideal $\I^\A$. By \cite[Proposition 1]{EMP}, 
\[
\mathbb{Q}(\frak{A})[\textit{\textbf{X}}_{\leq i-1}]\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}(\frak{A})[\textit{\textbf{X}}]/\fp_l^{\A}
\] 
is integral. Therefore polynomials $p_{l,j}\in\mathbb{Q}(\frak{A})[\Xb_{\leq i-1}][T]$ exist, monic in $T$, with $p_{l,j}(X_j)\in \frak{P}_l$ for each $j\in \{i,\hdots,n\}.$ Thence, 
%
\begin{align*}
&P_{j}(X_j) := \prod_l p_{l,j}(X_j)\in\I^\A, 
\end{align*}
%
for each $j \in \{i,\hdots,n\},$ and therefore 
\[
\mathbb{Q}(\frak{A})[\textit{\textbf{X}}_{\leq i-1}]\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}(\frak{A})[\textit{\textbf{X}}]/\I^{\A}
\] 
is integral.
\end{proof}
%
Let $P_{j} \in \mathbb{Q}(\frak{A})[\Xb_{\leq i-1}][T]$ be as in the proof of Proposition 7.2. Since $P_{j}(X_j) \in\I^{\A}= \langle f^\A,\frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_n} \rangle,$
 we can write
\[
P_{j}(X_j) = a_j f^{\A} + \sum_{l=1}^{n-i}b_{j,l} \frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_{i+l}}, ~a_j,b_{j,l} \in \mathbb{Q}(\A)[\textbf{X}].
\]
For each $P_j,$ there exists a Zariski open set $\Gamma_j \subset \C^{n^2}$ such that if $A \in \Gamma_j$,
then $A$ cancels none of the denominators of $a_{j}$ or $b_{j,l}$. Define $h_j \in \Q[\A]$ to be the product of the denominators of the coefficients of $a_j$ and $b_{j,l}$. Hence, if $A \in \Q^{n^2}-V(h_j)$ then $A$ cancels none of the denominators of $a_{j}$ or $b_{j,l},$ which are providing the integral dependence relation. Now we define 
\[
\Xi_i := \bigcup_{j=i}^n V(h_j) =V\left(\prod_{j=i}^n h_j \right), 
\]
and we obtain a bound on the degree of $\Xi_i$ by observing that
\[
\deg \Xi_i \leq \sum_{j=i}^n \deg h_j.
\]
Hence, if $A\in \Q^{n^2}-\Xi_i$ then
\[
P_j(X_j) \in \I^A,  
\]
for each $j \in \{i,\hdots,n\},$ and therefore the extension 
\[
\mathbb{C}[{\Xb}_{\leq i-1}]\rightarrow\mathbb{C}[\Xb]/\I(\pi_i,V^{A})
\]
is integral. We can obtain bounds for $h_j$ by applying an effective Nullstellensatz theorem. However, the theorem requires $P_{j}$ to be a polynomial. We can obtain a polynomial from $P_{j}$ by clearing denominators. We can multiply $P_{j}$ by the least common multiple of its denominators, which we will denote by $d_j \in \Q[\A_{i,j}]$. Put 
\[
\overline{P_{j}} := d_jP_{j}\in \Q[\A][\textit{\textbf{X}}],
\]
and note that $\pjb(X_j) \in \I^{\A}$ with 
\[
\pjb(X_j) = \ajb f^{\A} + \sum_{l=1}^{n-i}\bjb \frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_{i+l}}, ~\ajb,\bjb \in \mathbb{Q}[\A][\textbf{X}].
\]
%
\begin{proposition} 
$\deg \pjb\leq (D+1)^{n-i+1}.$ 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Eric and Mark}: I am unsure of how to do this part correctly, so I will assume 
\[
\deg \pjb\leq \Dt_j.

    \Q(\A,\Xb_{i-1}) &\rightarrow \Q(\A,\Xb_{i-1})[X_i,\hdots,X_n]/\Is.
\end{align*}
%
The minimal polynomial of the linear mapping defined by multiplication by $X_j$ in $\Q(\A,\Xb_{i-1})$ is \textbf{almost}(?) equal to $\pjb$ (the leading coefficient of $\pjb$ is $d_j$). It therefore follows by \cite[Proposition 1]{CGR} that
%
\begin{align*}
&\deg \pjb \leq (D+1)^{n-i+1}.&(2D)^{n-i+1}\textrm{?} 
\end{align*}
%
\end{proof}
%
Note that 
\[
\deg d_j \leq \deg \pjb \leq \Dt_j.
\]
%
\subsection{Applying the effective Nullstellensatz}
%
To apply the effective Nullstellensatz theorem, we first need to determine degree bounds, separately in $\Xb$ and $\A,$ of the polynomials in the membership relationship. We have
\[
\deg_{\Xb}\left\{ 
f^\A,\frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_n}
\right\}\leq D,
\]
\[
\deg_{\A}  
\left\{ 
f^\A,\frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_n}
\right\} \leq D,
\]
\[
\deg_{\Xb,T}(1-T\pjb) \leq \Dt_j +1 
\]
and
\[
\deg_{\A}(1-T\pjb) \leq \Dt_j.
\]
For each $j \in \{i,\hdots,n\},$ by \cite[Theorem 0.5]{EN}, there exists $\alpha_j \in \mathbb{Q}[\A]\setminus\{0\}$ with 
%
\begin{align*}
\alpha_j = \sum_{l=1}^{n-i+1} A_{j,l}(\A,\textit{\textbf{X}},T)g_l + B_j(\A,\textit{\textbf{X}},T)(1-\pjb T), \\ g_l \in 
\left\{ 
f^\A,\frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_{i+1}},\hdots,\frac{\partial f^\A}{\partial X_n}
\right\},~ A_{j,l},B_j \in \mathbb{Q}[\A][\Xb][T],
\end{align*}
%
and with the degree of $\alpha_j$ upper bounded by
%
\begin{align*}
    &\left(\prod_{k=1}^{n-i+1} D\right)\Dt_j 
    + (n-i+1)\left(\Dt_j+1\right)\left(\prod_{k=1}^{n-i}D \right)D\\
    = &\left(D^{n-i+1}\right)\Dt_j+
    (n-i+1)\left(\Dt_j+1\right)\left(D^{n-i+1} \right)\\
    &\leq D^{n}\Dt_j + n\left(\Dt_j+1\right)D^{n}\\
    &=D^n\left(\Dt_j + n\left(\Dt_j+1\right) \right).
\end{align*}
%
Now we will show that $\alpha_j$ is the only remaining denominator whose degree we need to bound. Substitute $T \leftarrow 1/\pjb$ so that 
\[
\alpha_j = \sum_{l=1}^{n-i+1} A_{j,l}(\A,\textit{\textbf{X}},1/\pjb)g_l + 0
\]
and
%
\begin{align*}
A_{j,l}(\A,\textit{\textbf{X}},1/\pjb) 
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n_l} A_{j,l,i}(\A,\Xb,1/\pjb)\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n_l} \left(\frac{1}{P_j^{k_i}}\right)\At_{j,l,i}(\A,\textit{\textbf{X}}), ~k_i \in \mathbb{Z}.
\end{align*}
%
Let $K := \max\{k_l\}$ so that 
%
\begin{align*}
    \pjb^K \alpha_j &= \pjb^K\left(\sum_{l=1}^{n-i+1} A_{j,l}(\A,\textit{\textbf{X}},1/\pjb)g_l\right)\\
    &= \sum_{l=1}^{n-i+1}\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n_l}\left(\pjb^{K-k_{i}}\right)\At_{j,l,i}(\A,\Xb) \right)g_l \in \Q[\A][\Xb].
\end{align*}
%
which shows that $\alpha_j$ is the only remaining denominator whose degree we need to bound other than $d_j$. Note as well that
\[
\pjb^K \in \I^{\A}.
\]
Therefore 
%
\begin{align*}
\deg h_j &\leq \left(\deg \alpha_j\right)\left(\deg d_j\right)\\
    &\leq \left(D^n\left(\Dt_j + n\left(\Dt_j+1\right) \right)\right)\Dt_j\\
    &=D^n\Dt_j\left(\Dt_j + n\left(\Dt_j+1\right) \right).
\end{align*}
%
\subsection{Proof of Theorem 7.1}
%
Now we obtain
%
\begin{align*}
    \deg \Xi_i 
    &\leq \sum_{j=i}^n \deg h_j\\
    &\leq  \sum_{j=i}^n \left( D^n\Dt_j\left(\Dt_j + n\left(\Dt_j+1\right) \right) \right) \\
    &=  (n-i+1)\left( D^n\Dt_j\left(\Dt_j + n\left(\Dt_j+1\right) \right) \right)\\
    &\leq  n D^n\Dt_j\left(\Dt_j + n\left(\Dt_j+1\right) \right) .
\end{align*}
%
And therefore,  
%
\begin{align*}
    \deg& \Delta_3 \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \deg \Xi_i\\
    &\leq n^2 D^n\Dt_j\left(\Dt_j + n\left(\Dt_j+1\right) \right),
\end{align*}
%
where if $A \in \C^{n^2} - \Delta_3$ then, for each $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\},$ the extension 
\[
\C[\textbf{X}_{\leq i-1}]\rightarrow\C[\textbf{X}]/\frak{I}(\pi_i,V^A)

\section{Proof of Theorem 3.1}
%
Recall Theorem 3.1: \textit{Suppose that $f \in \Q[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$ satisfies \textbf{H}. Then there exists a Zariski closed set $\D \subset \mathbb{C}^{n^2}$ of degree at most $D^{\textrm{\td}}$ such that, if $\textbf{A}$ is chosen from  $\C^{n^2}-\Delta$ ( $\Q^{n^2}-\Delta$?) then $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}$ for all $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}.$} 
%
\begin{proof}
Assume that $f\in \Q[X_1,\hdots,X_n]$ has degree at most $D$ and satisfies $\textbf{H}.$ By Theorem 5.1, there exists a Zariski closed set $\D_1\subset \C^{n^2}$ with the property that, if $A \in \C^{n^2}-\D_1$ then, for $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\},$ $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(1), \textbf{H}_i^{'}(2),$ and $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(3).$ Likewise, by Theorem 6.1, we obtain $\D_2 \subset \C^{n^2}$ with the property that if $A \in \C^{n^2}-\D_2$ then $f^A$ satisfies $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(4), \textbf{H}_i^{'}(5),$ and $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(6).$ By Theorem 7.1, $\D_3 \subset \C^{n^2}$ exists with $f^A$ satisfying $\textbf{H}_i^{'}(7)$ when $A \in \C^{n^2}-\D_3$. Clearly then, if 
\[
A \in \C^{n^2} - \bigcup_{i=1}^3 \D_i
\]
then $f^A$ satisfies  $\textbf{H}_i^{'}$ for all $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}.$ Take 
\[
\Delta = \prod_{i=1}^3 \D_i,
\]
and note that 
\[
\deg \D \leq  \prod_{i=1}^3 \deg \D_i.
\]
\end{proof}
%
Recall Corollary 3.2: \textit{Fix $S \subset \mathbb{Q}$ with $|S| \geq \epsilon^{-1} D^{\textrm{\td}}$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Then for $A\in S^{n^2}$ chosen randomly, the probability that $f^A$ satisfies $H_i^{'}$ for all $i \in \{1,\hdots,n\}$ is at least $1-\epsilon.$}
%
\begin{proof}
\[
Pr[A \in \Delta] \leq \frac{\deg \Delta}{|S|} \leq \frac{D^{\td}}{\epsilon^{-1}D^{\td}} = \epsilon.
\]
\end{proof}
%
%
%
%
\section{Bit complexity}
%
Recall Theorem 1.1: \textit{Suppose that $f\in\Q[X_1\hdots,X_n]$ is squarefree and satisfies $\deg f \leq D, \htt(f) \leq s,$ and assume that $f$ is given by a straight-line program $\Gamma$ of size $L$ with integer constants of height at most $b.$ There exists a randomized algorithm that takes $\Gamma, d,$ and $s$ as input and produces a zero-dimensional parameterization of a set that contains at least one point in each connected component of $V(f) \cap \R^n$ with probability at least $1/2$. Otherwise the algorithm either produces a subset of the points or FAIL. In any case, the algorithm uses 
\[
O^{\sim}(nk(Lb+D^{2n}(s+D)(L+n^3D+n^4)))
\]
bit operations, with $k \geq -\lg(1-2^{(-1/n)})$. The polynomials in the output have degree at most $D^n,$ and height at most
\[
O^{\sim}((s+D)D^n + nD^n).
\]
}
Recall as well that the algorithm can error on one side by producing a proper subset of the points. Running the algorithm $\kt$ times gives a list of $n$ zero-dimensional parameterizations, among which the highest cardinality output includes at least one point in each connected component with probability at least $1-(1/2)^{\kt}.$
%
\subsection{The Algorithm}
%
For a matrix $A \in \GL(n,\Q),$ let 
\[
Y_i = X_i^{A} = [b_i] \cdot \bbm X_1\\ \vdots \\ X_n \ebm, 
\]
where $b_i$ is the i-th row of $A^{-1}$.

\subsection{Proof of Theorem 1.1}
%
\textbf{Bit operation cost:} The following lists the costs for each step of Algorithm 1:
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item By our assumption on the size of $S$ we know that $|S| = \log (\epsilon^{-1}D^{\td}) \leq \td.$ Thus for $a_{ij} \in S$ we know that $|a_{ij}| \leq \td.$
    \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
        \item $O(L)$ operations are required to compute $f$ from its straight line program $\Gamma.$
        \item After applying the change of variables obtaining $f(A x)=f^A(x)$ the height grows at most by a factor of
        \begin{align*}
        \log(n!\cdot \max_{\frac{1\leq i\leq n}{1\leq j\leq n}}\{a_{ij}\}) &= 
        O(n\log n + n\log(D+1)) \\
        &= 
        O^\sim(\log(D+1)).
        \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item After computing the partial derivatives the height grows by at most another factor of $\log D$. Furthermore, preparing the straight line program for the gradient of $f$ does not introduce large integers. The integers in $\grad (f)$ are of the same magnitude as in $\Gamma$.
    \item 
    After applying \cite[Algorithm 2]{SH} $kn$ times, we obtain the
    following upper bound on the total number of bit operations required by the algorithm:
    \[
    O^\sim(kn(Lb+D^{2n}(s+D)(L+n^3D+n^4))),
    \]
    where it also follows from \cite[Algorithm 2]{SH} that the polynomials in the output have degree at most $D^n,$ and height at most
    \[
    O^{\sim}((s+D)D^n + nD^n).
    \]
\end{enumerate}
%
\par \noindent 
\textbf{Probability of success:} Note that when $\epsilon < 5/21$ (as stated in step 1 of Algorithm 1), then
\[
\pr[A \not \in \D] = 1-\epsilon > \frac{16}{21},
\]
so that after a single run of \cite[Algorithm 2]{SH}, the probability of success (ensuring all genericity properties and obtaining all points) is at least 
\[
\left( \frac{16}{21} \right) \left( \frac{21}{32} \right) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Thus, running \cite[Algorithm 2]{SH} $k$ times gives a list of outputs among which the highest cardinality set includes all points with probability at least $1-(1/2)^k$. We repeat this $n$ times to obtain $n$ zero-dimensional parameterizations. Thus, the probability that we have every point in each parameterization is $(1-(1/2)^k)^n$. We want 
\[
(1-(1/2)^k)^n>\frac{1}{2},
\]
which holds if and only if 
\[
k > -\lg(1-2^{(-1/n)}),
\]
thus proving Theorem 1.1. We can boost our success probability by running the main algorithm $\kt$ times, so that we obtain parameterizations whose reunion includes at least one point in each connected component of $V(f) \cap \R^n$ with probability at least $1 - (1/2)^{\kt}$.
